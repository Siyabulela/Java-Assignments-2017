/*Create a class named Box that includes integer data fields for length, width, and height.
Create three constructors that require one, two, and three parameters, respectively.
When one argument is passed to the constructor, assign it to length, assign zeros to
height and width, and display “Line created”. When two arguments are used, assign
them to length and width, assign zero to height, and display “Rectangle created”. When
three arguments are used, assign them to the three variables and display “Box created”.
Save this file as Box.java. Create an application named TestBox that demonstrates each
method works correctly. Save the application as TestBox.java.*/
