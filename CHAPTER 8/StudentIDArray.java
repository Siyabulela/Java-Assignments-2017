/*Write an application containing three parallel arrays that hold 10 elements each. The
first array holds four-digit student ID numbers, the second holds first names, and
the third holds the students’ grade point averages. Use dialog boxes to accept a student
ID number and display the student’s first name and grade point average. If a match
is not found, display an error message that includes the invalid ID number and allow
the user to search for a new ID number. Save the file as StudentIDArray.java.*/
