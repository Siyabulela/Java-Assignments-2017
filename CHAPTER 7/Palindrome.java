/*Write an application that determines whether a phrase entered by the user is a
palindrome. A palindrome is a phrase that reads the same backward and forward
without regarding capitalization or punctuation. For example, “Dot saw I was Tod”,
“Was it a car or a cat I saw?”, and “Madam, I’m Adam” are palindromes. Save the file
as Palindrome.java.*/
